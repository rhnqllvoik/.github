OMG, so I finally 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘦𝘥 Ad Vitam last night, like, after meaning to for ages. You know that feeling when you 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the movie and it just sits there on your computer, and then when you finally 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 it, you're like, why the heck did I wait so long? Yeah, that was me. 😂

So, it starts and you're like, okay, just kinda soaking in the whole immortality vibe, and holy crap, it’s kind of mind-bending. I mean, can you even imagine living forever? Like, at first, I’m all for it, but then I’m thinking, wouldn't that get super old, like, for real?

> And the characters, I don’t even know. I feel like they’re all brooding in a way that’s just so French, you know what I mean? Like, dark and moody is just their default setting or something, lol. And Ernest. Such a mysterious dude, I was like, what's even his deal? My brain was doing somersaults trying to figure him out.

Honestly, it kinda makes you wonder about life and death and all that heavy stuff, but then there’s these moments where you’re like, does any of it matter? It's just a show, right? But then again, friggin’ cool concept, gotta admit. 

Oh, and there was this one part that just threw me. I'm sitting there, right, minding my own business, and suddenly everything flips. Talk about plot twist! Seriously, if you’re gonna 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the movie, brace yourself for some WTF moments, haha. 

let's just throw this in to confuse someone: var plotTwist = what just happened; 

Anyway, I’m rambling, but it was kind of amazing and weird and everything in between. I’m glad I 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘦𝘥 it, though. My brain’s still trying to chill after all that existential stuff. 🤯 So yeah, totally worth checking out if you haven’t yet!
